## abstract: 
This project presents a blockchain-based system for identifying fake products using QR codes. By registering products on a blockchain platform and generating unique QR codes, the system enables consumers to verify product authenticity. Smart contracts automate the verification process, detecting counterfeit products and alerting stakeholders. This decentralized, tamper-proof system promotes transparency, trust, and security in the supply chain.
